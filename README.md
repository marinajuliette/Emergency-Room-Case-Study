# Emergency-Room-Case-Study
This is my Case Study project as the final requirement for my Google Data Analytics Certificate. The aim of this project is to put the skills I've gained to practice (i.e. Using R, Creating an RMakrdown file, Using ggplot2 to create graphs, etc.).

This Case Study will answer the Business Task: Determine if ER usage differs significantly by **race**, **ethnicity** or **insurance status** to inform equity-focused policy decisions.

To answer the Business Task I will be analyzing data that comes from the 2022 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). In order to gain more information on the data visit the website: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhamcs/documentation/index.html>.
